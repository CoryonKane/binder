##### This project is under work. This is only a back end part of the project, the front end's link will be added once it has its basic functionalities. Deployed version can be looked at: https://binder-backend.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui.html#/.

Short description of the project:

Binder is the application for Codecool students to get to know each other more easily in the online world. The existing solutions don’t really provide enough support since not everyone likes to add just anybody to their fb, and it’s a bit strange to start a conversation with someone you don’t know on Discord just like that. It is meant to be like in-school LinkedIn&Tinder&fb etc all-in-one.

Some features include that students can browse others based on specific interests or matching interests (technical, other, or both), or let the system pick random people; see the students with most similar interests on their profile page - also on other student's profile page see how well their interests match.

Students can organize online events based on interests, show off their projects on their profile page, and post their favourite links, videos etc.

Students can follow each other's posts, creating a news feed for themselves, and if the following is mutual, they will match each other, which will give access to private events, and the possibility to share contact info.
